## by Feras Alshaheen


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The aim here is to survey this data, find features of interest, explore them, and come up with conclusion and summary of the findings. 
The main variables of interest were the Type of users, thier age, their gender, and the time they spent using the bikes.
The type of users are divided for customers and subscribers. The age was categorized by groups. Each group has
range of birth years, and they are four groups people who were born between 1878 and 1980, second group 
are between 1981 and 1987, the third were born between 1998 and 1992, and the youngest are born 
between 1993 and 2001. There were three gender types shown males, females, and those who either 
identified themselves as others or didn't identify themsleves at all.

## Summary of Findings

The findings are the followings:
1- It was found that 91% of the users are subscribers and only 9% of them are customers.
2- It was found out 75% of the users are males, 23% are females, and only 2% categorized as others.
3- It was found that 26% of the riders were born between 1878 and 1980, 50% were born between 1982 and 1992, and the remaining 24% were born between 1993 and 2001.
4- The average duration among all users regardless of their age or gender, which is 10 minutes.
5- Most of the male bikers were born between 1878 and 1980, while most of the female bikers were born between 1981 and 1987.
6- It was found that the most senior bikers rent their bikes at Harry Bridge Plaza, while this area has lowest bike renting for the young bikers (born in the 90's). However,
   the young bikers rent their bikes Market St at 10th St mostly, and suprisingly this area has the lowest bike renting rate for senior bikers (born between 1878 and 1980)
7- While it was mentioned that the average duration is the same for all users, at closer look for the multivariate chart that explore the relation between gender, age, and duration, it was found 
   that those whose gender was categorized as others and were born between 1981 and 1987, are using the riding the bikes for longer time than average. They spend 25 minutes, whcih twice the average 
   period that the bikers usual take.
